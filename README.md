# What Does Console Application Mean?
A console application, in the context of C#, is an application that takes input and displays output at a command line console with access to three basic data streams: standard input, standard output and standard error.

A console application facilitates the reading and writing of characters from a console - either individually or as an entire line. It is the simplest form of a C# program and is typically invoked from the Windows command prompt. A console application usually exists in the form of a stand-alone executable file with minimal or no graphical user interface (GUI).

A console is an operating system window through which a user can communicate with the operating system or we can say a console is an application in which we can give text as an input from the keyboard and get the text as an output from the computer end. The command prompt is an example of a console in the windows and which accept MS-DOS commands. The console contains two attributes named as screen buffer and a console window.

In C#, the Console class is used to represent the standard input, output, and error streams for the console applications. You are not allowed to inherit Console class. This class is defined under System namespace. This class does not contain any constructor. Instead of the constructor, this class provides different types of properties and methods to perform operations.
